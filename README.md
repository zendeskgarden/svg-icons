> :seedling: Garden is a design system for Zendesk

This repo packages a collection of SVG icons used throughout Zendesk
products. All source icons are optimized for size + readability.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @zendeskgarden/svg-icons
```

The package contains a `src` folder with individual SVG icons along with
a combined "spritemap" `dist` of SVG symbols.

## Usage

Garden SVGs come in two flavors â€“ monochrome and two-tone. The primary
fill/stroke will always be specified as `currentColor`. This means CSS
text `color` style will cascade to the icon. Two-tone icons can receive
a secondary color via the `fill` style property. In the following
example, the top arrow of the "sort" icon will be blue; the bottom arrow
will be red (see _spritemap_ below for more re: SVG `use` with an
external source).

```html
<svg style="color: blue; fill: red;">
  <use xlink:href="index.svg#zd-svg-icon-14-sort">
</svg>
```

Once installed, SVG icons may be accessed in a variety of ways. The
following list demonstrates several possibilities, however usage will
vary depending on the particular needs of your application.

* **JavaScript**

  In the following snippet, a source SVG is loaded just like any other
  JS module. SVGs loaded in this manner will benefit from the same
  caching as any other JS asset.

  ```js
  import ZendeskIcon from '@zendeskgarden/svg-icons/src/26/zendesk.svg';

  class ZendeskButton extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <button><ZendeskIcon /></button>;
    }
  }
  ```

* **PostCSS**

  Several Garden [CSS
  Components](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/css-components) utilize
  the [postcss-inline-svg](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-inline-svg)
  plugin to compile SVGs into CSS.

  1. Configure the plugin:

  ```js
  "postcss-inline-svg": {
    "path": "node_modules/@zendeskgarden/svg-icons/src"
  }
  ```

  2. Load an SVG in your source CSS:

  ```css
  .icon {
    background-image: svg-load('14/remove.svg', color: #007FAB);
  }
  ```

  3. Build via postcss to inline the SVG into your destination CSS as a
     data URI:

  ```css
  .icon {
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='14' height='14' viewBox='0 0 14 14' color='%23007FAB' ...");
  }
  ```

* **Spritemap**

  The main distribution from the npm package is an SVG "spritemap"
  containing all source icons as `<symbol>` elements. Once that file is
  hosted, any icon may be externally referenced using its unique ID.

  ```html
  <svg>
    <use xlink:href="/path/to/index.svg#zd-svg-icon-14-chevron">
  </svg>
  ```

  By referencing the external resource, you take advantage of the
  browser cache. Subsequent `<use xlink:href>` will leverage the cached
  SVG spritemap. Note you'll need to use a polyfill like
  [svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) to
  compensate for browsers (IE9-11) that can't handle external SVG content.

* **Build pipeline**

  There are numerous plugins for handling SVG files via an asset bundler
  (webpack, gulp, grunt, etc.). Search
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=svg) and select one that fits your
  needs.
